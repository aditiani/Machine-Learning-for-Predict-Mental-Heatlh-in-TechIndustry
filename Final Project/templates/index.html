          <h2>Visualization</h2>
          <p>Workplaces that promote mental health and support people with mental disorders are more likely to reduce absenteeism, increase productivity and benefit from associated economic gains. 
            If employees enjoy good mental health, employees can make the most of your potential, cope with what life throws at you, play a full part in your relationships, your workplace, and your community.
            I decided to separate them into 3 aspects to see what factors that company give so employees want to get a treatment, such as employee's profiling, employee's work environtment, employee's mental health facilities.</p>

                Maybe some of them get sexual harrassment or racism at work because female are scarce in the tech industry.</li>

                Although the percentage of queer is very low, it still deserves to dig out some new insights. 
                For example, such a small proportion can show a significant difference in the count of who wants the treatments, indicating that for the queer, mental health problems are serious too. 
                In my opinion, maybe they received hate speech or discrimination in the workplace. </li>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Nearly 86% of employees report improved work performance and lower rates of absenteeism after receiving treatment for depression, according to an April 2018 article in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. 
            This means big gains in retention and productivity for employers. 
            By providing employees access to mental health benefits, the company can begin to create a culture of understanding and compassion at the tech company. 
            And having employees who feel cared for and happy isn’t just good, it’s good business.</p>

                <p><strong>Based on profiling the respondents</p>
                </strong>
                  <ul>
                  <li> Companies must know that gender and family history greatly influence the decision to get treatment for employees. 
                    So if the company wants to provide more support, the company must make an assessment of the employee's personality because different characters can determine different needs. 
                    Age can also be a trigger, considering that most of them are young so there is a high chance that they will be open-minded to get treatment.</li>
